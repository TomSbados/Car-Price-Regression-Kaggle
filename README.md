# Car-Price-Regression-Kaggle


My entry for the kaggle Car Regression competition. Managed to land in the top 50% for a quick project so I'm pretty happy. Extracting features from the dataset was crucial to improving score. Took many insights from strings in the dataframe using regex. Trained on the data using a randomized search with XGBoost and LGBoost final submission used a stacking regressor.
